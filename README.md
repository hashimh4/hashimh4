### Data Analytics and NLP Projects (with ML)

- **[Learning-Analytics (2024)](https://github.com/hashimh4/Learning-Analytics-Predicting-Performance)**
  - Three regression ML models (polynomial regression, ridge regression and elastic net regression) to predict student performance. Including data cleaning and preparation, initial dataset analysis, model evaluation, dataset suitability analysis and observations.
  
- **[NLP-Fake-News-Detection-with-Random-Forest-Classification-and-LSTMs (2024)](https://github.com/hashimh4/NLP-Fake-News-Detection-with-Random-Forest-Classification-and-LSTMs)**
  - Two fake news detector models, using ML (random forest classification) / DL (LSTMs) and BERT / TF-IDF feature extraction. See the evaluatory paper on the suitability of TF-IDF and BERT with the implemented models [here](https://github.com/hashimh4/NLP-Fake-News-Detection-with-Random-Forest-Classification-and-LSTMs/blob/main/fake_new_evaluating_TF-IDF_against_BERT.pdf).
  
- **[VR-Museum-Data-Analytics (2022)](https://github.com/hashimh4/VR-Museum-Data-Analytics)** *(Internship)*
  - Analysis of VR data collected from a 3D museum environment to assess scientific relationships between head movements, eye movements and the virtual position of a person.
  
- **[Data-Collection-and-Cleaning (2022)](https://github.com/hashimh4/Data-Collection-and-Cleaning)**
  - Pre-processing and cleaning three yearly survey datasets for visualisation. Using numpy, pandas, seaborn and matplotlib.
  
- **[ML-Predicting-Age-From-Humour-Styles (2021)](https://github.com/hashimh4/ML-Predicting-Age-From-Humour-Styles)**
  - Three models to predict age from humour style using supervised learning methods - linear regression, polynomial regression and KNN. Read the paper [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18wmz2JeDEA661GIP2cJo_U-BsuIm-ira/view?usp=drive_link).

### Computer Vision Projects (with DL and ML)

- **[audio-visual-music-transcription (2024)](https://github.com/CognitiveComputingLab/audio-visual-music-transcription)** / **[audio-visual-piano-transcription (2024)](https://github.com/hashimh4/audio-visual-piano-transcription)** _(Most starred ‚≠ê)_
  - The first publically avaliable joint automatic audio-visual piano transcription model. For videos from an overhead angle. Achieves near state-of-the-art results
  - Including a visual model with keyboard detection, hand detection and key detection. Where the notes covered by hands for each frame are passed as input to an audio model
  
- **[Computer-Vision-Style-Transfer (2024)](https://github.com/hashimh4/Computer-Vision-Style-Transfer)**
  - A movie-game style transfer model, using a CycleGAN model. Improved with human detection and human classification to further enhance the look of humans within frames
